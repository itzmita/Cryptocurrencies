# Cryptocurrencies
Unsupervised Machine learning

## Overview
This assignment involves unsupervised machine learning to create an analysis for prospective clients preparing to get into the cryptocurrency market. The client, a prominent investment bank, is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. As part of this analysis, we created a report which includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.
